## Copying my code is strongly not recommended, 19/42 is spying you, you don't want to get -42.

Except from that, all the code was done in one month, 18h per days.
19 is focused on learning by yourself, and copying the works of other is just the opposite from their goal. If you can't do an exercises, don't do it. 

Good luck ! Have a nice piscine, (stats just before the Exam C02)
