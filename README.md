## Copying my code is strongly forbidden, 19, 42 or whatever school you're in is spying you.

Except from that, all the code was done in one month, 15h per days.
19 is focused on learning by yourself, and copying the works of other is just the opposite from their goal. If you can't do an exercises, don't do it.
